# Task description

We had several measurements (MFL) of the pipe defects.

Each measurement has 3 channels.

Each measurement (defect) belongs to one of two defect location ( internal and external , or ID and OD).
Also, each defect belongs to different sub-type (i.e, corrosion, dent, gouge, etc.)

Candidate should:

1. Perform EDA. Draw conclusions.

2. On the basis of provided data, train classifier that will predict defect location for unlabeled data.
Scoring - F1 

Goal is to get F1 >0.8

3. Perform unsupervised clustering. 
Identify optimal number of clusters.
Draw most typical representative of each identified class.
